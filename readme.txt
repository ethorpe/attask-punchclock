This ATTask Application connects to attask using the attask public api and automatically logs time for you. It also is able to alert you when you try to submit your timesheet for review without completing all the days in a given period. It provides a log of time completed during the month and will also alert you if you start logging more then 12 hours of time incase the user forgot to stop the clock. 

There are other advancments that can be made. I was unable to create a good encryption algorithm for the saved password. Please do not use this commerically within a your company without adding your own password encryption functionality when saving the password. This is a great application and the application makes it easier to log time for its users and allows for granular auditing for a company using ATTask.
